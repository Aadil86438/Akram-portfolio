I will paste my existing company production code below.

Your task is to MODIFY the existing logic ONLY.
Do NOT redesign, refactor, or change coding style.
Do NOT change function names, file names, or method order.

========================
BACKGROUND
========================

- I have a `fetchDataTable` API written in Go.
- It fetches records from `ckyc_details` table and shows them in frontend using `v-data-table`.
- Pagination is already implemented and works correctly:
  - Page 1 → records 1–10
  - Page 2 → records 11–20
- Filters, pagination count, and UI rendering are already working fine.

========================
FRONTEND FLOW
========================

- Each row has two buttons:
  1) **Comments**
     - Opens dialog
     - Inserts comment into DB using an existing insert API
     - Table name: `ckyc_comments_log`
     - While inserting, the selected record `id` is already stored in this table

  2) **View History**
     - Should show all previously inserted comments for that record

========================
CURRENT PROBLEM
========================

- When user clicks **View History**, frontend calls an API every time.
- If user clicks View History 5 times → API + DB is hit 5 times.
- This must be completely avoided.

========================
REQUIRED SOLUTION (MANDATORY)
========================

- `fetchDataTable` API must fetch ALL required data in a SINGLE API call.
- While selecting from `ckyc_details`:
  - INCLUDE `id` column (this is mandatory).
- Comment history from `ckyc_comments_log` must be fetched INSIDE `fetchDataTable` API itself.
- Response must already contain comment history mapped to each record using `id`.

- After initial fetch:
  - When user clicks **View History**:
    - DO NOT hit API
    - DO NOT hit DB
    - ONLY show data already present in frontend memory

========================
FRONTEND RULES (STRICT)
========================

- Do NOT use:
  - async / await
  - encoder / decoder
  - payload wrappers
  - anonymous objects or structs
- Use:
  - normal promise syntax
  - data stored in Vue state
- View History must ONLY filter and display existing data.

========================
BACKEND RULES (VERY STRICT)
========================

- Use ONLY:
  - `json.Marshal`
  - `json.Unmarshal`
  where required
- Do NOT use encoder / decoder.
- Do NOT use anonymous structs.
- All structs must be named.
- Variable naming rules:
  - Local variables must start with `l`
  - Slices / arrays must end with `Arr`
  - Example:
    - `var lData string`
    - `var lRecordArr []SomeStruct`

========================
LOGGING & STYLE (1000% MANDATORY)
========================

- Follow existing company logging style EXACTLY:
  - Entry log
  - Exit log
  - Error log
  - `lErr`
  - `lErr.Error`
  - `pDebug`
  - `lDebug`
  - `errcode`
- Maintain:
  - Same indentation
  - Same function separation
  - Same call hierarchy
  - Same query style
  - Same order of operations
- Even a single comma, order, or log sequence must NOT change unless required.

========================
IMPORTANT NOTES
========================

- Insert comments API already exists.
- DO NOT modify insert logic.
- ONLY optimize fetch logic.
- Do NOT introduce new APIs.
- Do NOT introduce caching layers.
- Do NOT change pagination behavior.

========================
EXPECTED OUTPUT
========================

- Updated `fetchDataTable` code
- `id` included from `ckyc_details`
- Comment history attached to each record
- View History works without ANY API call
- Code must pass senior developer review without objections

I will now paste my existing company code below.
WAIT for the code.
DO NOT assume anything.
DO NOT respond until the code is pasted.
