I am working on existing production Go code.

Wherever the function `zohocrmdeal` is called, `generatetoken()` must be executed immediately before that call.

Background:
- A `generatetoken()` function already exists.
- Earlier, some required fields were missing, which caused:
  client_id declared and not used
- Later, my team lead shared an official email containing:
  - The correct JSON struct
  - The exact field names
  - The required keys (client_id, client_secret, refresh_token, etc.)
- I lost the previous ChatGPT output due to an accidental refresh.

I will now provide:
1. The email content (JSON struct and keys)
2. The current Go source code

What you must do:
- Use the provided fields and keys so that all declared values are actually used and no unused-variable errors remain.
- Ensure `generatetoken()` is executed before every `zohocrmdeal()` call.
- Do not create:
  - New functions
  - New files
  - New logic paths
- Do not change:
  - Existing business logic
  - Function names or signatures
  - Code structure
  - Formatting, naming style, or flow

This is company production code.
Make only the minimum required changes so the code works correctly with the provided fields.

Wait until I share the email content and code, then apply the changes.
