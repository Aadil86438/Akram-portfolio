I have an existing LIVE PRODUCTION Vue + Vuetify codebase.
This code is already deployed and MUST NOT be refactored or redesigned.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT change UI design
- Do NOT change layout or component structure
- Do NOT move components
- Do NOT add new methods, variables, or logic
- Do NOT add new styles, wrappers, or custom code
- Do NOT optimize or rewrite anything
- Apply ONLY a minimal, safe fix

CURRENT STRUCTURE:
Each uploader card contains:
- v-file-input (Choose File)
- Commit button
- Discard button

All of them are inside the same parent container (v-sheet).

REQUIRED FLOW (DO NOT CHANGE):
1. On initial load:
   - Choose File enabled
   - Commit & Discard disabled
2. After file upload success:
   - Choose File disabled
   - Commit & Discard enabled
3. After Commit:
   - All buttons disabled

This logic already works correctly and must remain untouched.

PROBLEM:
When clicking Commit or Discard, the file explorer popup opens unexpectedly,
even when v-file-input is disabled.

ROOT CAUSE (ALREADY IDENTIFIED):
Click event bubbling inside a shared container causes v-file-input
to capture clicks from Commit and Discard buttons.

WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED:
- File picker must open ONLY when clicking Choose File
- File picker must NEVER open when clicking Commit or Discard

ALLOWED FIX (ONLY THIS):
- Prevent click event propagation from Commit and Discard buttons
- Use event handling such as @click.stop (or equivalent)
- Apply the fix only on the buttons
- No other changes are allowed

DELIVERABLE:
- Show BEFORE vs AFTER
- Highlight only the exact minimal change
- Change the fewest characters possible
- Do not suggest alternate approaches or refactors

FINAL NOTE:
This is live production code.
Any unnecessary change will be rejected.
