I will provide you with my company’s standard backend code.

First, carefully analyze and understand the existing code style and flow, including:

API structure and layering

User handling approach

Error handling pattern

Logging format and methods

Database query execution style

Naming conventions

Code readability and organization


After fully understanding the standards, write a new API strictly following the same style and conventions.

Requirements for the new API:

The API should fetch data from a database table using a SELECT query

The SQL query must be written in a separate method/function, outside the API handler

The API should only call that query method, not contain inline SQL

No changes, improvements, or new patterns should be introduced

Do not add new variables, helpers, or abstractions beyond what already exists in the standard code

Error handling and logging must exactly match the existing approach


The final output should look like it was written by the same developer and team, fully compliant with company standards.





> I have an existing production-ready code that is working perfectly.
During code review, I was told that there is code repetition for multiple buttons, but the logic and behavior must remain exactly the same.

Your task:

Do NOT change any existing logic

Do NOT add new variables, features, or optimizations

Do NOT introduce new method calls or redesign the flow

Do NOT refactor in a way that affects execution order

Do NOT break the working behavior


Only do this:

Remove code repetition in the safest possible way

Reuse existing code without altering functionality

Keep all conditions, loops, and side effects exactly as they are


If avoiding repetition requires changing logic, then do not change it — just keep the code as-is.

Return the updated code and briefly explain only what repetition was removed, nothing else.
